Acetic acid is a weak acid and an important starting material for the production of vinyl acetate and acetic anhydride for the synthesis of long-chain carboxylic acids and many other organic compounds. It is also considered as a model acid present in unprocessed bio-oil. Moreover, the catalytic decomposition of acetic acid has been identified as a model for eco-friendly treatment for air pollution and wastewater. Considering its importance, we studied the catalytic decarboxylation reaction of acetic acid theoretically using the state of the art quantum chemistry; density functional theory (DFT).

The gas phase decarboxylation reaction of acetic acid occurs via two main steps and decarboxylation with currently used catalysts follows a similar mechanism.  Our recently published article  shows acetic acid decarboxylation occurs via a direct pathway when magnesium hydroxide cluster {[Mg(OH)2]5} is the catalyst. Our results suggest  that the decarboxylation of propionic acid (which is a component in sweat) will also occur via  a similar pathway with the same catalyst, and  we have confirmed this using the same theoretical methods.

This catalyst could provide a promising decarboxylation reaction pathway that suppresses undesirable by-products to produce high-quality vinyl acetate and bio-oil, and suggests the potential of Mg(OH)2 catalyst as a coating agent for textiles that decomposes sweat.
