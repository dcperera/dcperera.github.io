I am a computational chemist studying molecules using my fingertips. 

I did my bachelor's degree in Chemistry (with a Mathematics minor) at Ruhuna University, Matara, Sri Lanka. I worked with Prof. Jayendran C. Rasaiah ("https://omh.umeche.maine.edu/") at the University of Maine, Orono, ME during my time of Ph.D. Currently, I am a postdoctoral researcher at Indiana University, Bloomington, IN.
